<h4><code>Trade-off Analysis</code></h4>
<p><strong style="color: #000;"></strong></p>
<p><strong style="color: #000;">What: </strong><strong style="color: #000;"></strong>This project aims to create a visualization for user log files in the XML format generated by a software used by experts in the agronomy field.<br /> XMLs are not easy/convenient to read without a visualization tool <br /> Our goal is to isolate the human actions from the rest of the data that is generated by the software, and make patterns of use visible </p>
<p><strong style="color: #000;">Why: </strong>To see patterns in the actions of the users (experts) which will lead us to understand how experts use their tools and find the right solutions to the problems they face as well as determine how they choose the trade-offs in the solutions they reach. <br /> this in turn will help us design strategies and tools that make the process easier</p>
<p><strong style="color: #000;">How</strong>: A parallel axis graph that shows the patterns in the actions and dimensions with the ability to filter the data and explore different lengths of patterns.</p>

![ImageEx](/ScreenExample3.PNG?raw=true "Optional Title")

<p>The darker a stripe is the higher its count is. the count represents the number of times a pattern has been seen in the data. the parallel axis contain the actions that constitute the paterns</p>

<p><strong style="color: #000;">Interaction &amp; Filters:<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to load any Xml log file.</li>
<li>The ability to generate a graph for actions or dimensions. (in the end we found out that there where no apparent patterns in the dimention use => most Dim patterns had a count of 1 or 2)</li>
<li>The patterns are highlighted on mouse hover and their counts are displayed</li>
<li>The ability to choose the length of the patterns to display (2-10) .</li>
<li>Min/max filters for the pattern counts.</li>
<li>Inclusion/Exclusion filters for the actions (not yet implemented for dimensions).</li>
<li>"No loop" filter to remove the instances where an action loops over itself.</li>
</ul>
